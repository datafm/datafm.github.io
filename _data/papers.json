In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities and proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two methods, Shadow Attack and Outlier Attack, which generate manipulated datasets to inflate the compensation adversarially. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through \"shadow training\", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}, {"title": "D$^3$: A Large Dataset for Training Code Language Models to Act Diff-by-Diff", "link": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=UsqYcpiUTG", "abstract": "We introduce D$^3$, a dataset for training LMs to iteratively synthesize general-purpose Python source code by generating file diffs.

However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models such as Zephyr, Mistral, Qwen2, Llama3.1, Gemma2, and SPPO. Additionally, on six academic benchmarks including GSM8K, GPQA, MUSR, TruthfulQA, BBH, and ARC, our method improves their average accuracy.

However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship between covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be meaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear functional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates in one population.

However, the common derivation of influence functions in the data attribution literature is limited to loss functions that decompose into a sum of individual data point losses, with the most prominent examples known as M-estimators. This restricts the application of influence functions to more complex learning objectives, which we refer to as non-decomposable losses, such as contrastive or ranking losses, where a unit loss term depends on multiple data points and cannot be decomposed further. In this work, we bridge this gap by revisiting the general formulation of influence function from robust statistics, which extends beyond M-estimators. Based on this formulation, we propose a novel method, the Versatile Influence Function (VIF), that can be straightforwardly applied to machine learning models trained with any non-decomposable loss. In comparison to the classical approach in statistics, the proposed VIF is designed to fully leverage the power of auto-differentiation, hereby eliminating the need for case-specific derivations of each loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VIF across three examples: Cox regression for survival analysis, node embedding for network analysis, and listwise learning-to-rank for information retrieval. In all cases, the influence estimated by VIF closely resembles the results obtained by brute-force leave-one-out retraining, while being up to 1000 times faster to compute.

We address this challenge by developing an information-theoretic framework to quantify the marginal impacts of dataset features on the discrimination bias of any downstream classifier. Our approach theoretically argues for measures aligning with specific desired properties and fairness notions. Specifically, we postulate a set of desired properties for candidate discrimination measures and derive measures that (partially) satisfy them. Distinct sets of these properties align with different fairness criteria like demographic parity or equalized odds, which we show can be in disagreement and not simultaneously satisfied by a single measure. We employ the Shapley value from cooperative game theory to determine individual features' marginal contributions to overall discrimination. We show the equivalence among some candidate measures under Shapley value aggregation and rigorously prove its effectiveness in eliminating redundancy. We conduct a comprehensive empirical ablation study on real-world and synthetic datasets to validate our measures' efficacy in capturing features' discriminatory impacts. For synthetic data generation, we use a parametric linear structural causal model and systematically examine distinct parameter settings corresponding to diverse data correlation structures, generating numerous datasets under these conditions to rigorously validate our theoretical framework.

This framework suggests that measuring the fidelity of a method's mixing law can offer insights into its performance. Empirically, we find that existing methods set their mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in the inconsistent mixing performance we observe. Using this insight, we derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates the mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically adjust proportions. Empirically, Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out of 6 datasets by an average of 0.27 test perplexity points, whereas existing methods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points worse. Moreover, in a practical setting where proportions are learned on shorter runs due to computational constraints, Aioli can dynamically adjust these proportions over the full training run, consistently improving performance over existing methods by up to 12.012 test perplexity points.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}, {"title": "Demystifying Long CoT Reasoning in LLMs", "link": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=AgtQlhMQ0V", "abstract": "Scaling inference compute has become a key driver of advanced reasoning in large language models (LLMs). A proven approach for scaling inference compute is to generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs), enabling models to engage in structured reasoning strategies such as backtracking and error correction. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the underlying mechanics of long CoT reasoning\u2014examining the factors that enable models to generate extended reasoning trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we identify three key findings: 1) while SFT is not strictly necessary, it significantly simplifies training and improves efficiency; 2) reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute but are not guaranteed, making reward shaping essential for stabilizing CoT length growth; and 3) scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL, and we find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows promising potential, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning tasks such as STEM problem-solving. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs.", "decision": "Accept (Oral)"}, {"title": "Towards Internet-Scale Training For Agents", "link": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=UUEGIdyQI0", "abstract": "The predominant approach for training web navigation agents gathers human demonstrations for a set of popular websites and hand-written tasks, but it is becoming clear that human data is an inefficient resource. We develop a pipeline to facilitate internet-scale training for agents without laborious human annotations. In the first stage, an LLM generates tasks for 150k diverse websites. In the next stage, LLM agents complete tasks and produce trajectories. In the final stage, an LLM reviews the trajectories, and judges their success. Language models are competitive with human annotators, detecting and filtering out harmful content with an accuracy of 97\\%, generating feasible tasks with an 89\\% rate, and judging successful trajectories with an 82.6\\% accuracy. Scaling the pipeline, agents based on \\textit{Llama 3.1 70B} solve 16.7\\% of tasks for 150k sites. Training on the data generated by our pipeline is competitive with training on human demonstrations. In data-limited settings derived from Mind2Web and WebLINX, we improve \\textit{Step Accuracy} by up to +89.5\\% and +122.9\\% respectively for agents trained on mixtures of data from our pipeline, and human data.

However, in real-world scenarios, data partitions may contain corrupted labels, degrading ICL performance. We address this challenge by formulating partition selection as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each evaluation sample serves as a pull, allowing the model to identify the most reliable partitions iteratively. Using an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategy, we progressively refine exemplar selection to mitigate the impact of noisy data.

Existing defense methods show that such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially cropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as corrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial images and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean images after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise (guide) the LVLM's responses to the original images at inference time. We propose a black-box, training-free method called \\textbf{DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision)}. In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input.", "decision": "Accept (Poster)"}, {"title": "RepFair-QGAN: Alleviating Representation Bias in Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks Using Gradient Clipping", "link": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=ccZMAqkZge", "abstract": "This study introduces a novel application of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) by incorporating a new fairness principle, \\textit{representational fairness}, which improves equitable representation of various demographic groups in quantum-generated data.
